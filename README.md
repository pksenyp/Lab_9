# Laboratory work: Pointers. Pointers to Arrays

There are four different tasks in this laboratory work. When you open the file, you will see the menu, where you can select the number of the task and see its description.

### Task №1.

Find out how many bytes of memory are occupied by variables of the most popular types and pointers to them (char, short, int, long, float, double, long double).

### Task №3.

Write a program that, for a string that you type from the keyboard (the maximum length of the string is 20 characters) which tells you what number it occurs most often, or reports that the numbers in the string at all. If several digits occur with the same frequency in the string, display any of the matching digits as a leader. Use pointers to bypass strings.

### Task №6.

Given an array of 10 numbers of type double. Write a program that doubles the values of the elements in the array. Solve the problem using pointers.

### Task №8.

You have an array of 10 numbers of type double. Print the values of the zero, the second and the fourth element of the array, using the pointer.
